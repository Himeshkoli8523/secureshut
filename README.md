# 🔐 SecureShut – Anti-Theft Device Protection App

## 📌 Overview

**SecureShut** is a mobile security application designed to protect smartphones from **unauthorized access during theft or forceful usage**.  
When an intruder attempts to power off or misuse the device, SecureShut **displays a fake shutdown screen** to deceive the attacker while secretly performing security actions in the background.

The app captures critical evidence and sends it to a **pre-configured SOS contact**, helping the owner track and identify the intruder even without internet access.
